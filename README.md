### Hey, I'm Amaury B. Souza! 🐧

Focused on Linux administration and automation (Infrastructure as Code), Linux certified with over 7+ years of experience in IT infrastructure operations.
I’m member of the Viva o Linux community with several articles and scripts (Bash) published, I collaborate on pull requests and issues at Github projects. Also, I created a Medium blog to write stories about Linux, DevOps tools and Infrastructure as Code to help all professionals who are starting their IT journey.

In the moment I’m working as Linux Administrator at IBM, with experience in Linux (patching, troubleshooting, networking, systems, packaging), VMware, Ansible, Satellite, Shell Scripting, Regex and several tools to administrate the Linux servers.

In the past experiences, I got some experience with observability, I installed and configured Zabbix and Grafana to monitoring the infrastructure, designed maps and grafics at Zabbix to automate the environment, created several scripts(Bash) to automate the routine in the PROD servers, worked with network team to ensure the network environment working fine.
