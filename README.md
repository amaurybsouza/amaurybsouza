## Hi, I'm Amaury!üëã
{SRE/DevOps Engineer} dedicated to continuous learning, expanding my knowledge daily in areas like solutions architecture, infrastructure as code (IaC) & cloud native. I keep a newsletter filled with awesome DevOps stuff at [Substack](https://amauryborgessouza.substack.com/) and I love writing tech posts at [Medium](https://amaurybsouza.medium.com/). I was invited to participate into the [AWS Community Builders](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/developer/community/community-builders/) program and I have been selected as a [HashiCorp Ambassador](https://www.credly.com/badges/fa9fb10e-5ca6-45a4-87d1-d5c110d05f97) within open source community. Backing to the tech communit & open-source projects, feel free if you think that's necessary sponsor my work through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/amaurybsouza). For last months I have worked closely with several people to keep and create new possibilities to learn and share around Cloud contents and Hashicorp products. Finally, recently I was ranked 50th among the [TOP GitHub users](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/brazil.md) by public contributions in BrazilüöÄ
