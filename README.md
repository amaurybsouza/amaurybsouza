## Hey, I'm Amaury! 👨‍💻

I'm Senior Linux Administrator who is passionate about delivering a secure, scalable and modern infrastructure. I'm enjoy working with Linux (```Administration/Networking/Filesystems```), Scriping (```Bash```), Red Hat stack (```Red Hat Enterprise Linux```, ```Ansible```, ```Tower```, ```Satellite```), Hashicorp stack (```Terraform```, ```Consul```, ```Nomad```, ```Vagrant```) and ```Amazon AWS environment```. My interest in the DevOps culture led me to launch Medium blog, to write stories about Linux, cloud and IaC to help all professionals who are starting in their IT journey.
