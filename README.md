### Hi, I'm Amaury!👏🙌
Over 11yoe, I’ve built a strong track record in Linux, Cloud Security & DevSecOps, driving impactful contributions at leading banks (SunTrust, Bradesco) and consulting firms (CI&T, IBM, Kyndryl, etc.). As a Cloud Security Architect, I leverage automation and emerging technologies like AI to continuously enhance security posture. My passion for knowledge sharing extends beyond my work: I curate a DevSecOps newsletter at Substack, I love writing tech posts at Medium, and actively contribute to open-source communities [AWS U.G. Campinas](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/awscampinas/), [HashiCorp U.G. Campinas](https://www.meetup.com/campinas-hashicorp-user-group/), Hackerspaces, DoDs.
